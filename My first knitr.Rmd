My First knitr Document
============================================================

This is some text (i.e. a "text chunk")

Here is a code chunk

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x=rnorm(100)
mean(x)

## Introduction

This is some text, here is the code chunk
```{r simulation, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
x=rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

Let's first simulate some data
```{r simulatedata.echo=T}
x=rnorm(100)
y=x+rnorm(100,sd=0.5)
```

Here is a scatterplot of the data
```{r scatterplot, fig.height=4}
par(mar=c(5,4,1,1),las=1)
plot(x,y,main="My Simulated Data")
```

```{r fitmodel}
fit = lm(Ozone~Wind+Temp+Solar.R,data=airquality)
```

Here is a table of regression coefficients
```{r showtable,results="asis"}
library(xtable)
xt = xtable(summary(fit))
print(xt,type="html")
```
  
cache = T, first time run the documents, take a bit of time  
second time running the document when nothing changes, since it has stored   
in the disk, it won't redo the computation again
